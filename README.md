Modeling the spread of infectious diseases with computer simulations is an important step in learning to predict pandemics.  We have created  a  simplified  model  of  an  infectious  disease  spreading  over  a  population. The individuals  are  moving  around  in  a  random  fashion  over  a  graph  that  represents spatial locations.  Spreading of the disease is possible whenever an infected and a healthy individual share the same location.
